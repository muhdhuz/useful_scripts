## useful_scripts

Scripts that contain useful routines, recipes, and modules to encourage code reuse.  
Developed on Python 3, mostly to work with audio files. 

**Files**  
* [myUtils](https://github.com/muhdhuz/useful_scripts/blob/master/myUtils.py): most general modules go in here. e.g. for plotting, timing, directory/file manipulation etc.
* [resample_wav.py](https://github.com/muhdhuz/useful_scripts/blob/master/resample_wav.py): resamples individual wav files or a foldr containing wav files. 
* [trim_audio](https://github.com/muhdhuz/useful_scripts/blob/master/trim_audio.py): to trim wav files to a desired length

**Dependencies**  
* Take a look at the individual files/functions for the dependency required.
